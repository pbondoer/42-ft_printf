printf
------

 -> Loop through the string, find conversions
 -> Deduce a map of
   -> [strings] -> length
   -> [conversions] -> transform -> length
 -> Create a string large enough to hold the entire map
 -> Loop through the map and append the transformed strings

Possible optimizations
----------------------

 * Break the loops if the string gets too large
