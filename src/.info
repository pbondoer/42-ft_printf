parsing format:

1) map format to arg types with enum, add conversions to list

  arg 0 -> int
  arg 1 -> char *
  arg 2 -> NULL
  arg 3 -> int

2) populate list of args with corresponding data (list)

  arg 0 -> 42
  arg 1 -> "Hello world"
  arg 2 -> NULL
  arg 3 -> 123


3) start printing out text to a string in memory (sort-of-buffer) unless it
exceeds a certain amount of memory

4) once the string is entirely populated, perform a write of the string
